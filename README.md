Method to get power curve consumed across any component: Instantaneous Power - Run the simulation, place the cursor
over the component whose power you want to measure, press and hold the Alt key (cursor symbol becomes a
thermometer), left-click to plot power. This will display a graph of the power dissipated over the simulation time.

Average Power - After selecting the instantaneous power of a component, hold the “ctrl” button and click on the name of
the measurement in the measurement window. A new window will open displaying the average power.
